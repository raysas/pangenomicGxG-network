   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to quickly and reliably prioritize clinically approved compounds for their potential effectiveness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, as well as the list of drugs in clinical trials that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential COVID-19 efficacy. We find that no single predictive algorithm offers consistently reliable outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This outcome prompted us to develop a multimodal technology that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, finding that a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the performance of the best individual pipelines. We screened in human cells the top-ranked drugs, obtaining a 62% success rate, in contrast to the 0.8% hit rate of nonguided screenings. Of the six drugs that reduced viral infection, four could be directly repurposed to treat COVID-19, proposing novel treatments for COVID-19. We also found that 76 of the 77 drugs that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these network drugs rely on network-based mechanisms that cannot be identified using docking-based strategies. These advances offer a methodological pathway to identify repurposable drugs for future pathogens and neglected diseases underserved by the costs and extended timeline of de novo drug development.},

It is the largest matched phenotypic and genotypic dataset for M. tuberculosis to date. Here, we provide a summary detailing the breadth of data collected, along with a description of how the isolates were selected, collected, and uniformly processed in CRyPTIC partner laboratories across 23 countries. The compendium contains 6,814 isolates resistant to at least 1 drug, including 2,129 samples that fully satisfy the clinical definitions of rifampicin resistant (RR), multidrug resistant (MDR), pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR), or extensively drug resistant (XDR). The data are enriched for rare resistance-associated variants, and the current limits of genotypic prediction of resistance status (sensitive/resistant) are presented by using a genetic mutation catalogue, along with the presence of suspected resistance-conferring mutations for isolates resistant to the newly introduced drugs bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, and linezolid. Finally, a case study of rifampicin monoresistance demonstrates how this compendium could be used to advance our genetic understanding of rare resistance phenotypes. The data compendium is fully open source and it is hoped that it will facilitate and inspire future research for years to come.},

We introduce a neural machine translation (NMT) model that maps a source character sequence to a target character sequence without any segmentation. We employ a character-level convolutional network with max-pooling at the encoder to reduce the length of source representation, allowing the model to be trained at a speed comparable to subword-level models while capturing local regularities. Our character-to-character model outperforms a recently proposed baseline with a subword-level encoder on WMT‚Äô15 DE-EN and CS-EN, and gives comparable performance on FI-EN and RU-EN. We then demonstrate that it is possible to share a single character-level encoder across multiple languages by training a model on a many-to-one translation task. In this multilingual setting, the character-level encoder significantly outperforms the subword-level encoder on all the language pairs. We observe that on CS-EN, FI-EN and RU-EN, the quality of the multilingual character-level translation even surpasses the models specifically trained on that language pair alone, both in terms of the BLEU score and human judgment.},

   abstract = {Background: Early detection of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens and prescription of more effective antibiotics is a fast-emerging need in clinical practice. High-throughput sequencing technology, such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), may have the capacity to rapidly guide the clinical decision-making process. The prediction of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, often the cause of serious systemic infections, is more challenging as genotype-to-phenotype (drug resistance) relationship is more complex than for most Gram-positive organisms. Methods and Findings: We have used NCBI BioSample database to train and cross-validate eight XGBoost-based machine learning models to predict drug resistance to cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, and tobramycin tested in Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The input is the WGS data in terms of the coverage of known antibiotic resistance genes by shotgun sequencing reads. Models demonstrate high performance and robustness to class imbalanced datasets. Conclusion: Whole genome sequencing enables the prediction of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. We present a tool that provides an in silico antibiogram for eight drugs. Predictions are accompanied with a reliability index that may further facilitate the decision making process. The demo version of the tool with pre-processed samples is available at https://vancampn.shinyapps.io/wgs2amr/. The stand-alone version of the predictor is available at https://github.com/pieterjanvc/wgs2amr/.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest global problems threatening human and animal health. Rapid and accurate AMR diagnostic methods are thus very urgently needed. However, traditional antimicro-bial susceptibility testing (AST) is time-consuming, low throughput and viable only for cultivable bacteria. Machine learning methods may pave the way for automated AMR prediction based on genomic data of the bacteria. However, comparing different machine learning methods for the prediction of AMR based on different encodings and whole-genome sequencing data without previously known knowledge remains to be done. Results: In this study, we evaluated logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the prediction of AMR for the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftazi-dime and gentamicin. We could demonstrate that these models can effectively predict AMR with label encoding, one-hot encoding and frequency matrix chaos game representation (FCGR encoding) on whole-genome sequencing data. We trained these models on a large AMR dataset and evaluated them on an independent public dataset. Generally, RFs and CNNs perform better than LR and SVM with AUCs up to 0.96. Furthermore, we were able to identify mutations that are associated with AMR for each antibiotic.

   abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the nosocomial pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, is becoming a serious public health threat. While some mechanisms of AMR have been reported, understanding novel mechanisms of resistance is critical for identifying emerging resistance. One of the first steps in identifying novel AMR mechanisms is performing genotype/phenotype association studies; however, performing these studies is complicated by the plastic nature of the A. baumannii pan-genome. In this study, we compared the antibiograms of 12 antimicrobials associated with multiple drug families for 84 A. baumannii isolates, many isolated in Arizona, USA. in silico screening of these genomes for known AMR mechanisms failed to identify clear correlations for most drugs. We then performed a bacterial genome wide association study (bGWAS) looking for associations between all possible 21-mers; this approach generally failed to identify mechanisms that explained the resistance phenotype. In order to decrease the genomic noise associated with population stratification, we compared four phylogenetically-related pairs of isolates with differing susceptibility profiles. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on paired isolates and differentially-expressed genes were identified. In these isolate pairs, five different potential mechanisms were identified, highlighting the difficulty of broad AMR surveillance in this species. To verify and validate differential expression, amplicon sequencing was performed. These results suggest that a diagnostic platform based on gene expression rather than genomics alone may be beneficial in certain surveillance efforts. The implementation of such advanced diagnostics coupled with increased AMR surveillance will potentially improve A. baumannii infection treatment and patient outcomes.},

The enrichment analysis illustrated 30 genes in biological processes, 24 genes in molecular function, and 25 genes in cellular components having a significant role. The analysis of the gene interaction network revealed genes birA2, folP, pabC, folA, gyrB, glmM, gyrA, thyA_2 had maximum no. of interactions with their functional partners viz. 26, 25, 25, 24, 23, 23, 23, 23 respectively and can be considered as hub genes. Analyzing the enriched pathways and Gene Ontologies provides insight into AMR's molecular basis. In addition, the proposed study could aid the researchers in developing new treatment options to combat multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a huge problem in both developed and developing countries, and identifying strains resistant or susceptible to certain antibiotics is essential in fighting against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Whole-genome sequences have been collected for different microbial strains in order to identify crucial characteristics that allow certain strains to become resistant to antibiotics; however, a global inspection of the gene content responsible for AMR activities remains to be done. Results: We propose a pan-genome-based approach to characterize antibiotic-resistant microbial strains and test this approach on the bacterial model organism Escherichia coli. By identifying core and accessory gene clusters and predicting AMR genes for the E. coli pan-genome, we not only showed that certain classes of genes are unevenly distributed between the core and accessory parts of the pan-genome but also demonstrated that only a portion of the identified AMR genes belong to the accessory genome. Application of machine learning algorithms to predict whether specific strains were resistant to antibiotic drugs yielded the best prediction accuracy for the set of AMR genes within the accessory part of the pan-genome, suggesting that these gene clusters were most crucial to AMR activities in E. coli. Selecting subsets of AMR genes for different antibiotic drugs based on a genetic algorithm (GA) achieved better prediction performances than the gene sets established in the literature, hinting that the gene sets selected by the GA may warrant further analysis in investigating more details about how E. coli fight against antibiotics.},

   abstract = {Machine learning is a proven method to predict AMR; however, the performance of any machine learning model depends on the quality of the input data. Therefore, we evaluated different methods of representing information about mutations as well as mobilizable genes, so that the information can serve as input for a robust model. We combined data from multiple bacterial species in order to develop species-independent machine learning models that can predict resistance profiles for multiple antimicrobials and species with high performance. Machine learning has proven to be a powerful method to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) without using prior knowledge for selected bacterial species-antimicrobial combinations. To date, only species-specific machine learning models have been developed, and to the best of our knowledge, the inclusion of information from multiple species has not been attempted. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of including information from multiple bacterial species to predict AMR for an individual species, since this may make it easier to train and update resistance predictions for multiple species and may lead to improved predictions. Whole-genome sequence data and susceptibility profiles from 3,528 Mycobacterium tuberculosis , 1,694 Escherichia coli , 658 Salmonella enterica , and 1,236 Staphylococcus aureus isolates were included. We developed machine learning models trained by the features of the PointFinder and ResFinder programs detected to predict binary (susceptible/resistant) AMR profiles. We tested four feature representation methods to determine the most efficient way for introducing features into the models. When training the model only on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, high prediction performances were obtained for the six AMR profiles included. By adding information on ciprofloxacin from the additional 3,588 isolates, there was no reduction in performance for the other antimicrobials but an increased performance for ciprofloxacin AMR profile prediction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli . In conclusion, the species-independent models can predict multi-AMR profiles for multiple species without losing any robustness.  IMPORTANCE Machine learning is a proven method to predict AMR; however, the performance of any machine learning model depends on the quality of the input data.

   abstract = {Motivation: While the search for associations between genetic markers and complex traits has led to the discovery of tens of thousands of trait-related genetic variants, the vast majority of these only explain a small fraction of the observed phenotypic variation. One possible strategy to overcome this while leveraging biological prior is to aggregate the effects of several genetic markers and to test entire genes, pathways or (sub)networks of genes for association to a phenotype. The latter, network-based genome-wide association studies, in particular suffer from a vast search space and an inherent multiple testing problem. As a consequence, current approaches are either based on greedy feature selection, thereby risking that they miss relevant associations, or neglect doing a multiple testing correction, which can lead to an abundance of false positive findings. Results: To address the shortcomings of current approaches of network-based genome-wide association studies, we propose networkGWAS, a computationally efficient and statistically sound approach to network-based genome-wide association studies using mixed models and neighborhood aggregation. It allows for population structure correction and for well-calibrated P-values, which are obtained through circular and degree-preserving network permutations. networkGWAS successfully detects known associations on diverse synthetic phenotypes, as well as known and novel genes in phenotypes from Saccharomycescerevisiae and Homo sapiens. It thereby enables the systematic combination of gene-based genome-wide association studies with biological network information.},

   abstract = {Background: Predicting which pathogens might exhibit antimicrobial resistance (AMR) based on genomics data is one of the promising ways to swiftly and precisely identify AMR pathogens. Currently, the most widely used genomics approach is through identifying known AMR genes from genomic information in order to predict whether a pathogen might be resistant to certain antibiotic drugs. The list of known AMR genes, however, is still far from comprehensive and may result in inaccurate AMR pathogen predictions. We thus felt the need to expand the AMR gene set and proposed a pan-genome-based feature selection method to identify potential gene sets for AMR prediction purposes. Results: By building pan-genome datasets and extracting gene presence/absence patterns from four bacterial species, each with more than 2000 strains, we showed that machine learning models built from pan-genome data can be very promising for predicting AMR pathogens. The gene set selected by the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) feature selection approach further improved prediction outcomes, and an incremental approach selecting subsets of XGBoost-selected features brought the machine learning model performance to the next level. Investigating selected gene sets revealed that on average about 50% of genes had no known function and very few of them were known AMR genes, indicating the potential of the selected gene sets to expand resistance gene repertoires. Conclusions: We demonstrated that a pan-genome-based feature selection approach is suitable for building machine learning models for predicting AMR pathogens. The extracted gene sets may provide future clues to expand our knowledge of known AMR genes and provide novel hypotheses for inferring bacterial AMR mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the most urgent global threats to public health. Accurate detection of AMR phenotypes is critical for reducing the spread of AMR strains. Here, we developed PARMAP (Prediction of Antimicrobial Resistance by MAPping genetic alterations in pan-genome) to predict AMR phenotypes and to identify AMR-associated genetic alterations based on the pan-genome of bacteria by utilizing machine learning algorithms. When we applied PARMAP to 1,597 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, it successfully predicted their AMR phenotypes based on a pan-genome analysis. Furthermore, it identified 328 genetic alterations in 23 known AMR genes and discovered many new AMR-associated genetic alterations in ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, and it clearly indicated the genetic heterogeneity of AMR genes in different subtypes of resistant N. gonorrhoeae. Additionally, PARMAP performed well in predicting the AMR phenotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli, indicating the robustness of the PARMAP framework. In conclusion, PARMAP not only precisely predicts the AMR of a population of strains of a given species but also uses whole-genome sequencing data to prioritize candidate AMR-associated genetic alterations based on their likelihood of contributing to AMR. Thus, we believe that PARMAP will accelerate investigations into AMR mechanisms in other human pathogens.},

   abstract = {The emergence of microbial antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. In clinical settings, the key to controlling spread of resistant strains is accurate and rapid detection. As traditional culture-based methods are time consuming, genetic approaches have recently been developed for this task. The detection of antibiotic resistance is typically made by measuring a few known determinants previously identified from genome sequencing, and thus requires the prior knowledge of its biological mechanisms. To overcome this limitation, we employed machine learning models to predict resistance to 11 compounds across four classes of antibiotics from existing and novel whole genome sequences of 1936 E. coli strains. We considered a range of methods, and examined population structure, isolation year, gene content, and polymorphism information as predictors. Gradient boosted decision trees consistently outperformed alternative models with an average accuracy of 0.91 on held-out data (range 0.81‚Äì0.97). While the best models most frequently employed gene content, an average accuracy score of 0.79 could be obtained using population structure information alone. Single nucleotide variation data were less useful, and significantly improved prediction only for two antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin. These results demonstrate that antibiotic resistance in E. coli can be accurately predicted from whole genome sequences without a priori knowledge of mechanisms, and that both genomic and epidemiological data can be informative. This paves way to integrating machine learning approaches into diagnostic tools in the clinic.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis that poses a great threat to modern medicine. Effective prevention strategies are urgently required to slow the emergence and further dissemination of AMR. Given the availability of data sets encompassing hundreds or thousands of pathogen genomes, machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to predict resistance to different antibiotics in pathogens based on gene content and genome composition. A key objective of this work is to advocate for the incorporation of ML into front-line settings but also highlight the further refinements that are necessary to safely and confidently incorporate these methods. The question of what to predict is not trivial given the existence of different quantitative and qualitative laboratory measures of AMR. ML models typically treat genes as independent predictors, with no consideration of structural and functional linkages; they also may not be accurate when new mutational variants of known AMR genes emerge. Finally, to have the technology trusted by end users in public health settings, ML models need to be transparent and explainable to ensure that the basis for prediction is clear. We strongly advocate that the next set of AMR-ML studies should focus on the refinement of these limitations to be able to bridge the gap to diagnostic implementation.},

   abstract = {<p>Antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to public health worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool to identify genetic variants associated with this antibiotic resistance. By analyzing large datasets of bacterial genomes, GWAS can provide valuable insights into the resistance mechanisms and facilitate the discovery of new drug targets. The present study aimed to undertake a systematic review of different GWAS approaches used for detecting genetic variants associated with antibiotic resistance. We comprehensively searched the PubMed and Scopus databases to identify relevant studies published from 2013 to February 2023. A total of 40 studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies explored a wide range of bacterial species, antibiotics, and study designs. Notably, most of the studies were centered around human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The review seeks to explore the several GWAS approaches utilized to investigate the genetic mechanisms associated with antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, it examines the contributions of GWAS approaches in identifying resistance-associated genetic variants through binary and continuous phenotypes. Overall, GWAS holds great potential to enhance our understanding of bacterial resistance and improve strategies to combat infectious diseases.</p>},

   abstract = {The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms in bacterial pathogens, coupled with the dwindling number of effective antibiotics, has created a global health crisis. Being able to identify the genetic mechanisms of AMR and predict the resistance phenotypes of bacterial pathogens prior to culturing could inform clinical decision-making and improve reaction time. At PATRIC (http://patricbrc.org/), we have been collecting bacterial genomes with AMR metadata for several years. In order to advance phenotype prediction and the identification of genomic regions relating to AMR, we have updated the PATRIC FTP server to enable access to genomes that are binned by their AMR phenotypes, as well as metadata including minimum inhibitory concentrations. Using this infrastructure, we custom built AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) machine learning classifiers for identifying carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-lactam and co-trimoxazole resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae with accuracies ranging from 88-99%. We also did this for isoniazid, kanamycin, ofloxacin, rifampicin, and streptomycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, achieving accuracies ranging from 71-88%. This set of classifiers has been used to provide an initial framework for species-specific AMR phenotype and genomic feature prediction in the RAST and PATRIC annotation services.},

   abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance has caused chaos worldwide due to the depiction of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infective microorganisms. A thorough examination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and associated resistant mechanisms is vital to solving this problem. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is an opportunistic nosocomial bacterial strain that has acquired exogenous AMR genes that confer resistance to antimicrobials such as erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, moxifloxacin, fluoroquinolones, vancomycin, and others. A network of interactions, including 20 AMR genes, was created and analyzed. In functional enrichment analysis, Cellular components (CC), Molecular Functions (MF), and Biological Processes (BP) were discovered to have substantial involvement. Mutations in the rpl genes, which encode ribosomal proteins, confer resistance in Gram-positive bacteria. Full erythromycin and azithromycin cross-resistance can be conferred if more than one of the abovementioned genes is present. In the enriched BP, rps genes related to transcriptional regulation and biosynthesis were found. The genes belong to the rpoB gene family, which has previously been related to rifampicin resistance. The genes rpoB, gyrA, gyrB, rpoS, rpl genes, rps genes, and Van genes are thought to be the hub genes implicated in resistance in C. difficile. As a result, new medications could be developed using these genes. Overall, our observations provide a thorough understanding of C. difficile AMR mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Background: Gene-gene epistatic interactions likely play an important role in the genetic basis of many common diseases. Recently, machine-learning and data mining methods have been developed for learning epistatic relationships from data. A well-known combinatorial method that has been successfully applied for detecting epistasis is Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR). Jiang et al. created a combinatorial epistasis learning method called BNMBL to learn Bayesian network (BN) epistatic models. They compared BNMBL to MDR using simulated data sets. Each of these data sets was generated from a model that associates two SNPs with a disease and includes 18 unrelated SNPs. For each data set, BNMBL and MDR were used to score all 2-SNP models, and BNMBL learned significantly more correct models. In real data sets, we ordinarily do not know the number of SNPs that influence phenotype. BNMBL may not perform as well if we also scored models containing more than two SNPs. Furthermore, a number of other BN scoring criteria have been developed. They may detect epistatic interactions even better than BNMBL.Although BNs are a promising tool for learning epistatic relationships from data, we cannot confidently use them in this domain until we determine which scoring criteria work best or even well when we try learning the correct model without knowledge of the number of SNPs in that model.Results: We evaluated the performance of 22 BN scoring criteria using 28,000 simulated data sets and a real Alzheimer's GWAS data set. Our results were surprising in that the Bayesian scoring criterion with large values of a hyperparameter called Œ± performed best. This score performed better than other BN scoring criteria and MDR at recall using simulated data sets, at detecting the hardest-to-detect models using simulated data sets, and at substantiating previous results using the real Alzheimer's data set.Conclusions: We conclude that representing epistatic interactions using BN models and scoring them using a BN scoring criterion holds promise for identifying epistatic genetic variants in data. In particular, the Bayesian scoring criterion with large values of a hyperparameter Œ± appears more promising than a number of alternatives. ¬© 2011 Jiang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {There are many algorithms for detecting epistatic interactions in GWAS. However, most of these algorithms are applicable only for detecting two-locus interactions. Some algorithms are designed to detect only two-locus interactions from the beginning. Others do not have limits to the order of interactions, but in practice take very long time to detect higher order interactions in real data of GWAS. Even the better ones take days to detect higher order interactions in WTCCC data. We propose a fast algorithm for detection of high order epistatic interactions in GWAS. It runs k-means clustering algorithm on the set of all SNPs. Then candidates are selected from each cluster. These candidates are examined to find the causative SNPs of k-locus interactions. We use mutual information from information theory as the measure of association between genotypes and phenotypes. We tested the power and speed of our method on extensive sets of simulated data. The results show that our method has more or equal power, and runs much faster than previously reported methods. We also applied our algorithm on each of seven diseases in WTCCC data to analyze up to 5-locus interactions. It takes only a few hours to analyze 5-locus interactions in one dataset. From the results we make some interesting and meaningful observations on each disease in WTCCC data. In this study, a simple yet powerful two-step approach is proposed for fast detection of high order epistatic interaction. Our algorithm makes it possible to detect high order epistatic interactions in GWAS in a matter of hours on a PC. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Epistasis can have important practical consequences in the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). For example, genetic background plays an important role in determining the costs of resistance, and hence in whether resistance will persist in the absence of antibiotic pressure. Furthermore, interactions between resistance mutations can have important implications for the evolution of multi-drug resistance. I argue that there is a need to better characterize the extent and nature of epistasis for mutations and horizontally transferred elements conferring AMR, particularly in clinical contexts.

Results: We present an overview of the design choices and pitfalls that prove crucial in the application of network propagation methods to GWAS summary statistics. We highlight general trends from the literature, and present benchmark experiments to expand on these insights selecting as case study three diseases and five molecular networks. We verify that the use of gene-level scores based on GWAS P-values offers advantages over the selection of a set of ‚Äòseed‚Äô disease genes not weighted by the associated P-values if the GWAS summary statistics are of sufficient quality. Beyond that, the size and the density of the networks prove to be important factors for consideration.

Some variants have weak marginal effects on disease risk, but their joint effects are significantly stronger when occurring together. Most studies on such epistatic interactions have focused on methods for identifying the interactions and interpreting individual cases, but few have explored their general functional basis. This was due to the lack of a comprehensive list of epistatic interactions and uncertainties in associating variants to genes. Results We conducted a large-scale survey of published research articles to compile the first comprehensive list of epistatic interactions in human diseases with detailed annotations. We used various methods to associate these variants to genes to ensure robustness. We found that these genes are significantly more connected in protein interaction networks, are more co-expressed and participate more often in the same pathways. We demonstrate using the list to discover novel disease pathways.},

   abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. However, GWAS techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWAS method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results: In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach. GenEpi identifies both within-gene and cross-gene epistasis through a two-stage modeling workflow. In both stages, GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and constructs the prediction models by L1-regularized regression with stability selection. The simulated data showed that GenEpi outperforms other widely-used methods on detecting the ground-Truth epistasis. As real data is concerned, this study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both biological meanings and predictive power. Conclusions: The results on simulation data and AD demonstrated that GenEpi has the ability to detect the epistasis associated with phenotypes effectively and efficiently. The released package can be generalized to largely facilitate the studies of many complex diseases in the near future.},

In this paper, we develop a novel framework for detecting statistical interactions captured by a feedforward multilayer neural network by directly interpreting its learned weights. Depending on the desired interactions, our method can achieve significantly better or similar interaction detection performance compared to the state-of-the-art without searching an exponential solution space of possible interactions. We obtain this accuracy and efficiency by observing that interactions between input features are created by the non-additive effect of nonlinear activation functions, and that interacting paths are encoded in weight matrices. We demonstrate the performance of our method and the importance of discovered interactions via experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world application datasets.},

   abstract = {Background: Understanding the genetic networks and their role in chronic diseases (e.g., cancer) is one of the important objectives of biological researchers. In this work, we present a text mining system that constructs a gene-gene-interaction network for the entire human genome and then performs network analysis to identify disease-related genes. We recognize the interacting genes based on their co-occurrence frequency within the biomedical literature and by employing linear and non-linear rare-event classification models. We analyze the constructed network of genes by using different network centrality measures to decide on the importance of each gene. Specifically, we apply betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and degree centrality metrics to rank the central genes of the network and to identify possible cancer-related genes. Results: We evaluated the top 15 ranked genes for different cancer types (i.e., Prostate, Breast, and Lung Cancer). The average precisions for identifying breast, prostate, and lung cancer genes vary between 80-100%. On a prostate case study, the system predicted an average of 80% prostate-related genes. Conclusions: The results show that our system has the potential for improving the prediction accuracy of identifying gene-gene interaction and disease-gene associations. We also conduct a prostate cancer case study by using the threshold property in logistic regression, and we compare our approach with some of the state-of-the-art methods.},

There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that complex interactions are 'the norm' and, rather than amounting to a small perturbation to classical Mendelian genetics, interactions may be the predominant effect. Traditional statistical methods are not well suited for detecting such interactions, especially when the data are high dimensional (many attributes or independent variables) or when interactions occur between more than two polymorphisms. In this review, we discuss machine-learning models and algorithms for identifying and characterising susceptibility genes in common, complex, multifactorial human diseases. We focus on the following machine-learning methods that have been used to detect gene-gene interactions: neural networks, cellular automata, random forests, and multifactor dimensionality reduction. We conclude with some ideas about how these methods and others can be integrated into a comprehensive and flexible framework for data mining and knowledge discovery in human genetics.},

   abstract = {Background: Drug-target interaction prediction is of great significance for narrowing down the scope of candidate medications, and thus is a vital step in drug discovery. Because of the particularity of biochemical experiments, the development of new drugs is not only costly, but also time-consuming. Therefore, the computational prediction of drug target interactions has become an essential way in the process of drug discovery, aiming to greatly reducing the experimental cost and time. Results: We propose a learning-based method based on feature representation learning and deep neural network named DTI-CNN to predict the drug-target interactions. We first extract the relevant features of drugs and proteins from heterogeneous networks by using the Jaccard similarity coefficient and restart random walk model. Then, we adopt a denoising autoencoder model to reduce the dimension and identify the essential features. Third, based on the features obtained from last step, we constructed a convolutional neural network model to predict the interaction between drugs and proteins. The evaluation results show that the average AUROC score and AUPR score of DTI-CNN were 0.9416 and 0.9499, which obtains better performance than the other three existing state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: All the experimental results show that the performance of DTI-CNN is better than that of the three existing methods and the proposed method is appropriately designed.},

Recent advances demonstrate that it is possible to extract learned interactions from trained neural networks. It has also been observed that, in neural networks, any interacting features must follow a strongly weighted connection to common hidden units. Motivated by the observation, in this paper, we propose to investigate the interaction detection problem from a novel topological perspective by analyzing the connectivity in neural networks. Specially, we propose a new measure for quantifying interaction strength, based upon the well-received theory of persistent homology. Based on this measure, a Persistence Interaction Detection (PID) algorithm is developed to efficiently detect interactions. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated across a number of interaction detection tasks on several synthetic and real world datasets with different hyperparameters. Experimental results validate that the PID algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

Although evidently a useful approach, it is often argued that this is not a realistic biological model and that epistasis (that is, the statistical interaction between SNPs) should be included.

   abstract = {The evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a persistent threat to global public health. Sequencing efforts have already yielded genome sequences for thousands of resistant microbial isolates and require robust computational tools to systematically elucidate the genetic basis for AMR. Here, we present a generalizable machine learning workflow for identifying genetic features driving AMR based on constructing reference strain-agnostic pan-genomes and training random subspace ensembles (RSEs). This workflow was applied to the resistance profiles of 14 antimicrobials across three urgent threat pathogens encompassing 288 Staphylococcus aureus, 456 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1588 Escherichia coli genomes. We find that feature selection by RSE detects known AMR associations more reliably than common statistical tests and previous ensemble approaches, identifying a total of 45 known AMR-conferring genes and alleles across the three organisms, as well as 25 candidate associations backed by domain-level annotations. Furthermore, we find that results from the RSE approach are consistent with existing understanding of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance due to mutations in the main drug targets, gyrA and parC, in all three organisms , and suggest the mutational landscape of those genes with respect to FQ resistance is simple. As larger datasets become available, we expect this approach to more reliably predict AMR determinants for a wider range of microbial pathogens.},
